NOTE: Even though this is supposed to feed 4-6 people, we're in college and all responsible for binge eating at least once, especially during hell week. So let's just say this feeds 0.253-0.5 people.

  <li>In a medium skillet, cook six slices of bacon until crispy. Set bacon aside and remove excess fat from the pan.</li>

  <li>In a medium bowl, whisk eggs, milk, chopped bacon, and cheddar cheese.</li>
  <li>Pour egg mixture over hash browns and spread evenly.</li>
  <li>Bake for 20 minutes, or until the surface is golden brown and eggs are cooked through.</li>
